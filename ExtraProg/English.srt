42

Jon Snow is dead.

Who killed him?

44
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,514
- I did.
- ( shouting resumes )

45
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,883
And Bowen Marsh
and Othell Yarwyck

46
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,268
and the other officers
in this castle.

47
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,054
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

48
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,807
- <i>( men shouting )</i>
- ( pounds on table )

49
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,110

- ( shouting stops )

50
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,445
<i>We've committed treason,</i>
<i>all of us.</i>

51
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:52,649
Jon Snow was
my Lord Commander.

52
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:55,451
I had no love for him.

53
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,904
That was no secret.

54
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,241
But I never once
disobeyed an order.

55
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,744
Loyalty is the foundation

56
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,879
on which the Night's
Watch is built.

57
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,332
And the Watch means
everything to me.

58
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,384
I have given my life,

59
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:15,588
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

60
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:22,478
Jon Snow was going to destroy
the Night's Watch.

61
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:25,181
<i>He let the wildlings</i>
<i>through our gates</i>

62
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:28,735
as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

63
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,606
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

64
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:37,443
and raped and murdered.

65
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,781
Lord Commander Snow
did what he thought was right,

66
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,784
I've no doubt
about that.

67
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,088
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

68
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:52,375
He thrust a terrible
choice upon us.

69
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,628
And we made it.

70
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,467
( men murmuring )

71
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,306
( whimpering )

72
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,642
Davos: <i>He'll have seen</i>
<i>we didn't come.</i>

73
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,811
Thorne will have
made it official by now.

74
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:13,396
Castle Black is his.

75
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:16,649
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

76
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,317
Jon was my friend.

77
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,621
And those fuckers
butchered him.

78
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:24,157
Now we return the favor.

79
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,658
We don't have
the numbers.

80
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,710
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

81
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,829
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>Lord Commander Snow for long,</i>

82
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:33,132
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

83
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:37,720
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

84
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,006
We all die today.

85
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,809
I say we do our best
to take Thorne with us when we go.

86
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:46,312
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

87
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,815
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

88
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,268
You're not the only ones
who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

89
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,195
Bolt the door.

90
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,197
Don't let anyone in.

91
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,365
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

92
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,537
<i>( door closes )</i>

93
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,372

( wind howling )

95
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:19,629
Ramsay: <i>She was 11 the first time</i>
<i>I saw her.</i>

96
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,383
The kennelmaster's
daughter.

97
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:28,805
She smelled of dog.

98
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:35,728
I wasn't much older,
but everybody was already afraid of me.

99
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:39,398
You certainly were.

100
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,405
Myranda wasn't, though.

101
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:50,376
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

102
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,328
She was fearless.

103
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,081
There was nothing
she wouldn't do.

104
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:04,590
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

105
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,263
I wish you could
be here to watch.

106
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:18,187
Maester: <i>Shall I have a grave</i>
<i>dug for her, my lord?</i>

107
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:22,692
<i>Or would you rather</i>
<i>the men build a pyre?</i>

108
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,832
Buried, burned?

109
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:31,584
This is good meat.

110
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,119
Feed it to the hounds.

111
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:37,840
Roose: Your command of the cavalry
was impressive.

112
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,843
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

113
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,596
Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

114
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,681
- No.
- A shame.

115
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,683
I'd reward the man.

116
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:51,103
Still,
a great victory.

117
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,222
Do you feel
like a victor?

118
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,196
I rebelled
against the crown

119
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,365
to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

120
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,984
Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

121
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,320
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

122
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:10,740
is the same as facing a prepared
Nd provisioned Lannister army?

123
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,244
No.

124
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,831
A reckoning will come.

125
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,549
We need the North
to face it.

126
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:22,501
The entire North.

127
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:25,838
They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

128
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,592
We no longer have
Sansa Stark.

129
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,894
You played
your games with her.

130
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,326
You played your games with
the heir to the Iron Islands

131
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,599
and now they're both gone.

132
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,517
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

133
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,152
<i>They won't get far.</i>

134
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,238
I'm glad to hear it.

135
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:45,658
Without Sansa, you won't be able
to produce an heir.

136
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:48,828
And without an heir,
well...

137
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,000
let's hope
the maesters are right

138
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,002
and Lady Walda's

139

<i>( barking continues )</i>

144
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,577
We have to cross here.

145
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:42,797
( gasps ) I can't.

146
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,248
It's the only way
to throw off the hounds.

147
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:46,802
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

148
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,422
I've seen what his hounds
do to a person.

149
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,507
This way is better.

150

Sansa.

157

Sansa.

Stay here.
I'll lure them away.

161
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,671
No, I won't make it
without you.

162
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,507
You will.

163
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:16,842
Go north, only north.

164
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,761
Jon is Lord Commander
at Castle Black.

165
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:20,513
He'll help you.

Where is Lady Bolton?

- Dead.
- Liar.

Theon: <i>She broke her leg</i>

Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

204
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,047
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

205
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,383
and give my life
for yours if need be.

206
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:48,053
I swear it by the old gods
and the new.

207
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,865
And I vow...

208
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:05,070

...meat and mead

212
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:20,336
And I pledge to ask
no service of you

213
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,921

bring you dishonor.

219
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:20,612
A ship from Dorne
has sailed into the harbor.

220
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,732
Myrcella.

<i>( bell tolling )</i>

223
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,725
Do you remember
the first time you saw a dead body?

224
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,728
Mother.

225
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,732
All I could think about
when she died

226
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,034
was what would happen
to her now.

227
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:55,657
Every day,
every night,

228
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,076
what does Mama
look like now?

229
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:02,714
Has she started
to bloat?

230
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:06,752
Has her skin
turned black?

231
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,923
Have her lips
peeled back from her teeth?

232
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:18,764
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

233
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:23,151
I think about her beautiful little face
starting to collapse.

234
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,438
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

235
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,240
I have to.

236
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,411
I have to. It's not right she has
to suffer alone.

237
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,747
She's not suffering.
She's gone.

238
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,700
No one can
hurt her anymore.

239
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,087
She was good.

240
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,375
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

241
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,128
I don't know where
she came from.

242
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:55,133
She was nothing like me.

243
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,686
No meanness,
no jealousy, just good.

244
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,471
I know.

245
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:03,809
<i>I thought if I could</i>
<i>make something so good,</i>

246
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:06,478
so pure...

247
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,817
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

248
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,453
She was my daughter
and I failed her.

249
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,039
No, I knew
this would happen.

250
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,291
The witch told me
years ago.

251
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:24,329
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

252
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,999
"And gold their shrouds."

253
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,667
Everything she said
came true.

254
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:30,502
You couldn't
have stopped it.

255
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:32,254
It's prophecy.
It's fate.

256
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,340
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

257
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:38,594
You told me yourself
when Father died.

258
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,562
You said we had
to stay together.

259
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:43,899
You said people would try
to tear us apart, take what's ours.

260
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:45,517
That was a prophecy, too.

261
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:47,903
I didn't listen to you
and everything you said came true.

262
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,439
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

263
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:52,908
Fuck everyone
who isn't us.

264
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,526
We're the only ones
who matter,

265
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,745
the only ones
in this world.

266
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,304
And everything
they've taken from us,

267
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,449
we're going
to take back and more.

268
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,704
We're going to take
everything there is.

269
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:16,682
"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

They scream in agony

271
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,687
they do not feel
the flames,

for now they see

they concealed,

274
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,528
I'd like to see
my brother.

275
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,897
- Confess.
- Please.

276
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,982
How is he?
At least tell me that.

277
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:35,400
Confess.

278
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:41,573
I am the queen
and I demand to see my brother.

279
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,659
<i>Sinners</i>
<i>don't make demands.</i>

280
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:46,461
They make confessions.

( sighs )
Our other guests need you.

285
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,433
- ( gasps )
- There.

286
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,271
Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

287
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:14,773
I'll speak with her.

288
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,578
My brother,
can you tell me how he is?

289
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:25,283
It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

290
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,453
Your husband
misses you dearly.

291
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,591
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

292
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,844
It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

293
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:40,432
But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

294
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:43,351
And only confession
can purge sin.

295
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,138
I have nothing
to confess.

296
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:50,859
So you believe
you are pure?

297
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,811
Perfect?

298
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:55,280
Wholly without sin?

299
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:57,983
None of us are.

300
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,738
You have started
down the path.

301
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,324
But you have
many miles to go.

303
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,924
I always envied Oberyn.

He lived.

305
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:26,428
He truly lived.

306
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:28,346
Sailed around the world.

307
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,348
Fought men
from every country.

308
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:32,851
Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

309

- And men.
- And men.

310
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,689
He experienced
everything

while I sat here

alive and well fed.

313
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,532
But that is life.

314
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,253
We each have our roles.

315
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:56,124
Oberyn was born
to be an adventurer.

316
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,093
And I was born to rule.

317
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,961
The gods
are not fools.

318
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:02,931
You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

319
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,517
And Oberyn, pfft,

320
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,302
he would have been
a terrible ruler.

321
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:10,772
Your mother is a brilliant woman,
you know that?

322

When was the last time
you left this palace?

326

You don't know
your own people.

- <i>Their disgust for you.</i>
- <i>( Doran coughing )</i>

328
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:57,936
Elia Martell raped and murdered,
and you did nothing.

329
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:02,607
Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

330
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,411
You're not a Dornishman.

331
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,748
You're not our prince.

Your son is weak
just like you.

335
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:23,361
And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

336
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:48,637
I told you
I'm not hungry.

00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,877
You walk as though the paving stones
were your personal property.

354
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:06,164
I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

355
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,299
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

356
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,003
Because you
have no cock.

357
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,476
( baby fussing )

358
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:26,267
( speaking Valyrian )

359
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,857
She thinks you want
to eat her baby.

360
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,694
( speaking Valyrian )

361
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:50,875
( speaks Valyrian )

362
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,217
- Varys: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- <i>I know what mhysa means.</i>

363
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,186
- Varys: Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

364
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:04,806
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen
as she used to be.

365
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,641
The Sons of the Harpy?

366
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,309
Very possibly.

367
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:13,114
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

368
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:17,152
told them human beings
weren't even property to begin with.

369
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:19,404
You can see why
they're unhappy.

370
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,790
Of course,

371
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:24,576
it could also
be the freed men.

372
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:28,079
<i>( people speaking Valyrian )</i>

373
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:32,417
<i>( man speaking Valyrian )</i>

374
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:39,474
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

375
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:42,927
She did fly away on a dragon
and not come back.

376
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,781
It's a problem.

377
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,452
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

378
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:11,673
Whoever you are,
wherever you go,

379
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,959
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

380
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:18,046
We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

381
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:21,015
The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

382
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:22,967
in the fighting pits
very carefully,

383
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:25,720
which means they take
orders from someone.

384
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:27,939
And have you started
looking for that someone?

385
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:30,809
My little birds
have already taken wing.

386
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:35,396
Soon they'll return,
singing songs of men in gold masks.

387
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:39,284
<i>( men shouting</i>
<i>in Valyrian )</i>

388
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,820
- ( people shouting )
- <i>( bell tolling )</i>

389
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,254
- ( shouting continues )
- <i>( bell continues tolling )</i>

390
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:14,269
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

391
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,092
Goat?

392
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,794
Ram.

393
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,546
You think
our friend got him?

394
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:45,967
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

395
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:50,221
We're on the right
path, then.

396
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:53,441
Daario: Perhaps she's tired
of being queen.

397
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,610
I don't think
she likes it very much.

398
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,896
She's too smart
to like it.

399
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:59,814
Maybe she's flown
somewhere else,

400
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
somewhere far away
from men like us.

401
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:04,819
I've been
all over the world.

402
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:06,821
There's no escaping
men like us.

403
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:09,624
There's no escaping
her, eh?

404
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:12,911
You keep coming back.
Why?

405
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,495
You know why.

406
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:18,583
Isn't it frustrating

407
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:22,086
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

408
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:23,638
Of course it is.

409
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,307
You're a romantic.
I admire that.

410
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:28,393
Sometimes I look at you
and I think,

411
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:30,812
"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

412
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:32,597
If you grow old.

413
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:33,932
If I grow old.

414
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:36,234
I hope I do.

415
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,069
I want to see what
the world looks like

416
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:39,771
when she's done
conquering it.

417
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:41,906
So do I.

418
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:04,379
Daario:
Huh, an army?

419
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:05,880
Not an army.

420
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,715
A horde.

421
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:34,575
Dothraki?

422
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,684
They have her.

423
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,202
( people shouting )

424
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:41,976
- ( shouts in Dothraki )
- ( groans )

425

( chuckles, kisses )

427
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,944
No.

428
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:04,895
( men laugh )

429
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,881

Thank you.

435
00:40:47,427 --> 00:40:49,977
Man: Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

436
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,762
- Man #2: <i>Probably had it coming.</i>
- Man: <i>Maybe so,</i>

437
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:53,481
<i>but I'm not risking it.</i>

438
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,182
- Man #2: <i>Just can't do it.</i>
- Man: <i>All right.</i>

439
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,685
Woman: <i>Honesty as well.</i>
<i>He gets it.</i>

440

441
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:04,275
Waif: <i>Are you listening,</i>
<i>blind girl?</i>

442
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,612
Do you hear them talking?

443

<i>Do any of them</i>
<i>talk to you?</i>

444

<i>No.</i>

445
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,870
So sad.

- Stand and fight, blind girl.

448
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:28,265
I can't see.

We are both
anointed knights.

Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.

<i>who throw down their arms</i>
<i>before nightfall.</i>

463
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:10,451
<i>And you, Ser Davos,</i>
<i>I will allow you to travel south</i>

464
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,404
a free man
with a fresh horse.

465
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:17,124
Davos:
<i>And some mutton.</i>

466
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:18,792
<i>I'd like some mutton.</i>

467
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,713
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.

468
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:26,417
I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it
south without starving.

469
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,423
We'll give you food.

470
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:35,726
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

471
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:39,263
<i>Or you can leave her here with us,</i>
<i>whichever you choose.</i>

472
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:44,184
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

473
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:47,655
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

474
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:51,909
We'll discuss amongst ourselves

In my learned opinion,
we open that door--

478
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,016
And they'll
slaughter us all.

479
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:18,435
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

480
